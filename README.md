# F1DriverDemo

This a 2D, 2 players racing game demo I coded in blitz basic 2 when I was fifteen and I was the only person coding and having an amiga in my countryside. So please no jugement, I cry myself when I read the code 26 years later.

I just did a few change to make it run and learn packaging. I leave it like there even the F1DRIVER1.0.doc for the fun.

I post it it for archive.


Tested on an Amiga 500 and 1200.
